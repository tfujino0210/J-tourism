This is a repository for the 2nd project in CAPP 30239 1 (Winter 2021) Data Visualization for Policy Analysis.

I made four charts with d3 on Javascript to explain the potential of Japanese inbound tourism.

This is the first time to code with Javascript and d3.
This is very challenging for me and I sometimes had hard times in debagging.
However, I learned a lot and it was a lot of fun.

Thank you so much!

Settings (ways to define heights, width, etc.) are largely based on the instructor's example.
