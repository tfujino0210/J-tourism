      <p class="comment" id="comment_0">While Japan was a major source of outbound tourists in the world for a long time, 
         <br>but Japan was one of major destinations of overseas travelers in 2010s too.
         <br>The growth in the number of inbound visitors in 2010s was remarkable.
         <br>Actually, the number of inbound travelers in 2019 was 32 millions, 
         <br>which was four times of that in 2010. 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan
         <br>was overcome and we hope to get over the pandemic too.</p>
